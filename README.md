This is the work of a three-person group project for CIS 1050 at UPenn. This project looks at three World Development Indicators (health, economic, and educational focuses) across three different countries, including some pre-and post- Covid analysis.

This project includes three-dimensional analysis which involved the employment of data cleaning, bootstrapping, permutation testing, data visualizations, linear regression, cross validation (via Leave-One-Out method), residual sum of squares (RSS) and six total hypothesis tests. All of this data is sourced from a Kaggle dataset that is also attached as a cvs file. 

The main conclusions made from this data are as follows:

For Health: 
1. We reject the null hypothesis that there is no difference between genders in the percent survival to age 65.

For Economic: 
1. We reject the null hypothesis that gender has no association with the percent of people in vulnerable employment in Germany.
2. We discover an association between the share of youth not in EET (Education, Employment, Training) and the total employment to population ratio. 

For Education: 
1. We reject the null hypothesis that mean-sex-difference of bachelors degree attainment remained constant overtime.
2. We fail to reject the null hypothesis that there is a significant differnce in male and female bachelors attainment in the US.
3. We fail to reject the null hypothesis that there is a significant differnce in male and female bachelors attainment in the Germany.
